 * This is the main Arduino project file for this Bluetooth
 * sensor project.  The Arduino will obtain data from a
 * temperature sensor, humidity sensor, barometer/altimeter,
 * and UV light sensor.  It will send the results via Bluetooth
 * to a smartphone or other Android device.  The first version
 * of the project will only support Android devices.
